# 2.1. Write metric queries

## Calculate a metric from log lines

In Loki, you can easily calculate metrics based on the number of log lines that have certain properties -- for example, the rate of error logs. This is called **log range aggregation**. 

In this section of the workshop we will analyze log volume, using Loki's query-time JSON parsing, and LogQL metric functions `count_over_time` and `sum`.

1.  From the Grafana main menu, choose **Explore** and then from the data source picker, select the **LokiNGINX** datasource.

1.  Click on the **Code** button to show the LogQL code editor. Paste the following query into the query box then press **Run query**:

    ```
    {filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} |= "Googlebot"
    ```

    Notice that you get JSON log lines of googlebot requests. **Click a log line** to see its details.

1.  At this point, Loki hasn't yet parsed the JSON. It shows the log line in plain text. To parse the log line, we need to add a parser, like `json`.

    **Change the query** to the following and then press **Run query**:

    ```
    {filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} |= "Googlebot" | json
    ```

    Now **click a log line** to expand it. 
    
    Notice how the fields from the JSON message have been parsed by Loki and are now shown in the _Fields_ panel. We can now use these fields in a metric query. 
    
    This screenshot highlights just a couple of the fields that have been extracted:

1.  Edit the query to this and then run it:

    ```
    sum by(status) (count_over_time({filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} |= `Googlebot` | json [5m]))
    ```

    Now Grafana will show the amount of Googlebot requests per minute, split by (HTTP) status code.

    **TIP:** To understand a Loki LogQL query, click on the **Explain query** toggle.

1.  Finally, edit the query to this and run it:

    ```
    sum by (request_method) (count_over_time({filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} | json [5m]))
    ```

1.  Click the **+ Add query** button and paste in the following query, which calculates the total number of log entries over time in our NGINX log:

    ```
    sum by (request_method) (count_over_time({filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} | json [5m]))
    ```

    Grafana shows the results of the two queries together, in the same graph. This graph allows us to see:

    - The total number of requests over time
    - The number of requests which came from Googlebot, broken down by HTTP status code
    - The proportion of Googlebot requests, compared to all requests

    This information was extracted by Loki in real time, without having to parse logs upfront.

## Calculate a metric based on a value in the log

In Loki, you can also calculate metrics using values inside the log line itself -- for example, graphing the average response time, or the average payload size over time. This is called an **unwrapped range aggregation**. It uses the `unwrap` function to pass a field from the log line to a metric function, such as `avg_over_time` or `max_over_time`.

1. Run the following query to extract the `bytes_sent` field from every JSON log line. This will draw a chart of how many avg bytes are requested by GoogleBot for every 5 minutes:

    ```
    avg_over_time({filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} |= "Googlebot" | json | unwrap bytes_sent [5m]) by (host)
    ```

2. Click the **+ Add query** button to add another query:

    ```
    max_over_time({filename="/var/log/nginx/json_access.log"} |= "Googlebot" | json | unwrap bytes_sent [5m]) by (host)
    ```

    **TIP:** `max_over_time` calculates the maximum of all values in the specified interval (in this case, 5 minutes).

    Notice that a second metric series is added to the graph, where we return the max amount of response bytes within that `5m` interval.

The completed graph from this exercise shows us the average bytes sent by NGINX over time, as compared with the largest payload sent, over the same time period.
