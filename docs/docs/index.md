# Welcome

Welcome to this Grafana Labs **Introduction to Loki** workshop. 

## Pre-event checklist

To ensure a smooth start for the workshop, please follow the steps/checklist below before you join the event:

- For this workshop, you need to have admin access to a (non-shared) Grafana v11 or higher instance with the Explore Logs plugin installed. 
    
    - We recommend [signing up for our free Grafana Cloud tier](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user?pg=hp&plcmt=hero-btn1) which comes with a managed Grafana instance with Explore Logs preinstalled.

    - Or, if you are bringing your own Grafana instance to the workshop, make sure you have installed the **Explore Logs** plugin, by going to Administration -> Plugins -> Explore Logs -> Install.

- Please ask your presenter for the details of the data sources to add to your Grafana instance.

- Familiarity with Prometheus, including its data model and PromQL basics, is highly recommended to get the most from the workshop.

- The workbook will be shared on the day of the workshop.

Please reach out with any questions you might have in the meantime.

Thank you and see you in the webinar.
