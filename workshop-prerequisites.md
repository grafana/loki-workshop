Hello,

To ensure a smooth start for the upcoming Loki Workshop, please follow the steps/checklist below before you join the event:

- For this workshop, you need to have admin access to a (non-shared) Grafana v7.5 or higher instance. I recommend [signing up for our free cloud tier](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user?pg=hp&plcmt=hero-btn1) which comes with a managed Grafana instance.
- Please ask your presenter for the details of the data sources to add to your Grafana instance.
- Familiarity with Prometheus, including its data model and PromQL basics, is highly recommended to get the most from the workshop.
- The workbook will be shared on the day of the workshop.

Please reach out with any questions you might have in the meantime.

Thank you and see you in the webinar.
